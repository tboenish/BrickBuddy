Hello!
This is my BrickBuddy project - a Lego catalog application I am building.
It uses Django for the backend and React for the frontend.

I started this project because I wanted to learn React and improve my
skills with Django. I decided to create a Lego catalog application 
because I collect Legos as a hobby and wanted to make something
that I would actually use.

Current Features:
Browse sets by theme - Browse Lego sets sorted by theme displaying some basic information about the sets such as piece count and release date

Planned Features:
User login
Allow users to create lists of sets they want / own
